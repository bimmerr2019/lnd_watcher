goal: create a extremely short program that you can eyeball and tell
it's not malicious. This program will monitor your lightning node, and
if any invoices are paid, it will send a telegram message to you.

The node needs to be on the local network: ie, 192.168.1.XXX I will be
making REST API URL calls to get the data. Program runs once a min and
sleeps otherwise.

this is just for fun, and no guarantees are made.
